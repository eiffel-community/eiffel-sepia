# Eiffel Sepia
This repository contains the Sepia Eiffel Protocol Implementation Architecture. It forms part of the larger [Eiffel Community](https://eiffel-community.github.io), where it provides guidance both to contributors and users of the Eiffel protocol and its implementations. While there is an infinite number of possible solutions to the problem of implementing the Eiffel protocol, Sepia represents one such solution, recommended and supported by the community.
