        <p class="section-paragraph">Similar to the <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/edition-lyon/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelAnnouncementPublishedEvent.md">EiffelAnnouncementPublishedEvent</a>, the Announcement Publishing role in Eiffel Sepia is unconnected to any other roles. Its responsibility is to publish announcements, the subject of which may vary from case to case. As there are no defined semantics of these announcements, they are primarily intended for human consumption or ad-hoc dashboards and visualizations, and consequently there are no collaborators of this role. A simple implementation of the Flow Context Definition role merely consists of an API and/or GUI where the relevant properties of the context object can be entered, whereupon the correct event syntax is formed and published. There is little need for internal storage or management of announcement data, as the events themselves can be used as a data source.</p>
